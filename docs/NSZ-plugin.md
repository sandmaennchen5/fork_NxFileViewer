# NSZ conversion plugin

NxFileViewer uses the official [nicoboss/nsz](https://github.com/nicoboss/nsz) Windows CLI as a separate process. The viewer's built-in NSZ reader remains responsible for browsing and integrity checks; conversion does not replace it.

## Opened file

Open **Tools → NSZ → Compress and verify…** for NSP/XCI, or **Decompress and verify…** for NSZ/XCZ, then select an output directory. Only the applicable action is enabled. Successfully converted output opens in the viewer with its verification result.

## Batch

Run a folder integrity check, then choose **Compress valid files…** or **Decompress valid files…**. These actions process all matching files reported as Original, including rows hidden by the error filter. Firmware is excluded. Relative subdirectories are preserved. Source files are rechecked immediately before conversion, so stale batch results cannot authorize an invalid source.

Completed outputs are added to the results. Source rows show conversion status and original/output byte sizes. Conversion failures also appear under the errors-only filter, without changing the original file's integrity result. CSV exports include conversion status, target path and sizes. Cancellation stops the process tree; completed outputs remain, while the current temporary output is discarded.

## Installation and updates

- **Tools → NSZ → Install / update plugin…** fetches the latest stable GitHub release, excluding drafts and prereleases. Initial conversion also installs the plugin when needed.
- Files are stored in `Plugins/NSZ` next to `NxFileViewer.exe`. The application directory must be writable for installation and updates. Managed paths in `active.json` are relative so the application can be moved with its plugin. AppData installations are not read, imported or used as a fallback. Install the plugin in the program directory. Custom executable paths remain unchanged.
- The updater selects the official Windows x64 or ARM64 CLI asset, validates the SHA-256 digest published by GitHub, and runs `--help` with a timeout to check the required options. Only then is the active-version pointer replaced. This is a CLI compatibility check, not a conversion test against every game.
- The previous installed version remains available through **Use previous version**. Rolling back turns off automatic update checks so the next conversion keeps that version.
- **Plugins → NSZ Plugin** controls checks before conversion, compression level (1–22, default 18) and an optional custom executable. Leave the path empty for managed releases. A custom executable is checked for compatibility but is never automatically replaced.
- If an update check fails and a compatible version is already installed, the viewer logs a warning and continues with that version. A failed initial installation prevents conversion.
- Automatic installation requires 64-bit Windows and network access. New upstream releases with renamed assets or incompatible CLI options are rejected rather than activated.

## Verification and file handling

The source is kept under a read lock while its NCA hashes/signatures are verified, converted, and the result is checked. Only `Original` is accepted; the existing setting for missing delta fragments applies. This checks NCA integrity, not a whole-container byte-for-byte comparison.

The plugin receives the viewer's detected `prod.keys` path via `--keys`. Compression uses `-K -V` to preserve additional files/partitions and request NSZ's own verification. No deletion or overwrite flags are passed. See the upstream [CLI documentation](https://github.com/nicoboss/nsz/blob/master/docs/usage.md).

Each conversion writes to a unique temporary subdirectory on the destination volume. The expected non-empty output must pass NxFileViewer's integrity check before it is moved to its final name. Existing targets offer Replace, Save with numbering, or Cancel. Replacement occurs only after successful output verification; numbering skips occupied file and directory names, including conflicts arising during conversion. Before each operation, the viewer asks whether to delete sources after success (default: keep). Sources are deleted only after the verified output is published. Deletion failures retain the output and show a warning. A failed check, plugin failure or cancellation removes the temporary output. Temporary data may remain if Windows denies cleanup; it can be recognized by the `.nxfv-nsz-` folder prefix.

Allow disk space for both the original and the new file, plus temporary decoding data required by solid NSZ verification. Large conversions can take time; the process phase is shown as indeterminate progress.

## Startup failures

`NSZ exit code: -1` at the `--help` compatibility check means the external executable failed to start or return successful help. On 2026-10-05 the official 5.0.0 Windows x64 CLI was downloaded, its published SHA-256 was verified, and the failure was reproduced on the local host: the PyInstaller bootloader could not load `python311.dll` (`LoadLibrary` reported an invalid memory access). The same failure occurred outside the sandbox and with a separate child-process TEMP/TMP directory. This does not establish the cause on every Windows computer.

The viewer now identifies this specific bootloader message and displays a localized explanation without logging raw CLI output, key values or DLL paths. Keys are not needed for the help check. A failed update is not activated and an existing installed version is retained. A working alternative standalone NSZ CLI can be selected in Plugins → NSZ Plugin and must pass the same help check. Python scripts cannot be selected directly as the executable; a script-based installation requires a suitable launcher, which the current custom-executable setting does not provide automatically.

### Verified fallback for the Windows standalone CLI

Further diagnosis on the same Windows host (build 26300) found that the official 5.0.0 GUI archive, verified against its GitHub SHA-256, runs `--help` successfully with redirected input/output, whereas the standalone CLI fails to load Python. Thus this host can run the official GUI build in CLI mode; the exact DLL-level cause in the standalone package remains undetermined.

For the specifically identified PyInstaller Python-DLL startup failure on x64, managed installation now downloads the official `nsz-gui-windows-x64.zip` asset, verifies its published digest, extracts only the named standalone executable and checks `--help`. It passes CLI arguments when converting, so the GUI is not opened. No Windows protection settings or keys are changed. Other failures do not trigger this fallback. Source-asset and executable hashes are retained in installation state so subsequent update checks do not repeatedly download the GUI package. A fallback failure leaves the previous active version unchanged.

NSZ child processes receive TEMP/TMP/TMPDIR under `Temp/NSZ` next to the viewer executable. These per-process directories are removed after exit. Kivy/XDG cache locations are also set under the application Cache directory. No AppData storage fallback is used. Existing AppData files are left untouched.

The batch overview follows the selected result row. Completed overview metadata is retained in memory for immediate row selection without reopening or decompressing solid NSZ files. Files without retained metadata load asynchronously; stale loads are discarded and selecting firmware uses its firmware details.

## Compression mode and block size

Plugins → NSZ Plugin provides Automatic, Solid / Blockless, and Block compression. Automatic preserves upstream defaults (solid for NSP→NSZ and blocks for XCI→XCZ); existing settings files keep this default. Solid explicitly passes `--solid`. Block explicitly passes `--block --bs <exponent>`; the size selector covers powers of two from 16 KiB to 4 GiB (exponents 14–32), default 1 MiB (20). The selector is enabled only for explicit Block mode. Block compression supports efficient random/backward reads; solid generally yields slightly better compression. These flags are omitted during decompression. Compatibility checks require the corresponding CLI options. See [official NSZ options](https://github.com/nicoboss/nsz/blob/master/docs/usage.md).

`--keys` always receives `ActualProdKeysFilePath`, the same detected/selected `prod.keys` used by NxFileViewer and displayed in Settings. No separate plugin keys setting is needed.

NSZ settings are in **Settings → Plugins**, alongside the **Program** and **Updates** tabs. Each settings page applies, cancels and resets its own options; saving a general draft does not overwrite separately saved plugin options.

## Operation progress

Conversion displays the file index and three phases: source verification, conversion, and output verification. Overall batch progress includes all three phases. When the NSZ CLI prints percentages, the viewer displays them with speed and estimated remaining time when available. Carriage-return progress output is processed immediately; updates are throttled to keep the interface responsive. Only recognized numeric progress fields are displayed, never raw CLI output or key values. Publishing the verified output has its own status message.
