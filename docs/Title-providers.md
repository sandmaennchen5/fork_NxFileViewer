# Title metadata and website sources

Choose **Title name source** under **Settings → Program**. Presets are named choices; editable URL fields are shown where applicable.

- **Tinfoil** uses the built-in Tinfoil API template.
- **TitleDB (GitHub)** downloads the selected regional catalog (default DE.de) and looks up embedded title IDs, with US.en fallback. Valid catalogs are cached under `Cache/TitleDB` beside the executable and refreshed after 24 hours. Failed refreshes retain old catalogs and retry after five minutes when cached data exists.
- **NLib API** uses `https://api.nlib.cc/nx/{TitleId}?lang={Language}`. Language follows the interface/system language, with English fallback for unsupported languages. NLib's icon field is mapped to the title image.
- **Custom** allows editing a title API template, initially based on Tinfoil.

Applying settings changes subsequent requests. The per-title memory cache includes provider, URL, region and language, and expires after 24 hours. Optional numeric/string ratings are accepted; malformed optional ratings do not discard otherwise valid title information.

If online information is unavailable, renaming uses local NACP titles when present. DLC without either source uses the existing NO_TITLE placeholder. Unwritable cache storage does not prevent using downloaded titles in memory; no alternative storage location is selected.

## Title websites

The independent title-page selector offers **Tinfoil**, **NX Content** and **Custom**. Preset URLs are fixed; Custom shows an editable template initialized from Tinfoil. `{TitleId}` is replaced when opening the browser. Website selection does not change the metadata provider used for renaming.

## Manual refresh

Use **Settings → Updates → Refresh TitleDB** to download the saved region and US.en fallback even when existing catalogs are fresh. Valid catalogs replace cache files atomically; failures retain the previous catalog. Per-title responses are invalidated afterwards, including partial refresh success. The selected provider is unchanged.

## Sources and validation

Catalogs use [blawar/TitleDB](https://github.com/blawar/titledb); the NLib adapter targets [NLib API](https://github.com/ghost-land/Nlib-API).

Automated tests cover routing, language/icon mapping, embedded title-ID lookup, persistent/stale caches, malformed updates, fallback, settings changes, optional ratings and offline renaming. Tests use synthetic or mocked responses rather than requiring live services.
